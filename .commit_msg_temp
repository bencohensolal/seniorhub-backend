feat(invitations): add auto-accept endpoint for seamless onboarding

Add POST /v1/households/invitations/auto-accept endpoint to automatically
accept all pending invitations for authenticated user's email.

Problem solved:
- User clicks invitation link → redirected to app
- User authenticates/signs up
- App now calls /auto-accept
- All pending invitations for that email automatically accepted
- User immediately becomes household member
- No manual "accept invitation" step needed

Implementation:
- AutoAcceptPendingInvitationsUseCase: finds and accepts all pending invitations
- Endpoint returns acceptedCount and list of households joined
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Continues processing even if one invitation fails

User flow:
1. Click email link → app opens with token
2. Sign in/sign up → authenticated
3. App calls POST /auto-accept → memberships created
4. App navigates to household → full access ✅

This fixes the URGENT TODO item #13: 403 errors after invitation acceptance.
Now the onboarding flow is seamless and automatic.
