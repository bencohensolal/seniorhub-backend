fix(medications): make autocomplete endpoint truly public (no auth)

Root cause of 401 errors:
- Mobile app was receiving 401 Unauthorized responses
- registerAuthContext plugin was enforcing auth on ALL routes
- Only /health was exempted from authentication
- Medication autocomplete needs to be public for CORS proxy use case

Solution:
- Add /v1/medications/autocomplete to public endpoints list
- Update authContext plugin to check multiple public endpoints
- Remove authentication-related code from route handler
- Update documentation to clarify endpoint is truly public

Changes:
- src/plugins/authContext.ts: Add publicEndpoints array with autocomplete
- src/routes/medicationRoutes.ts: Remove requester logging, clarify no auth

This fixes the 401 errors preventing the mobile app from searching
French medications. The endpoint now works without authentication headers.
