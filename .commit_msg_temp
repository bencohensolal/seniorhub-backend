fix(medications): use native https module instead of fetch for French API

Root cause of empty results:
- Node.js native fetch() API ignores custom agent parameter
- The rejectUnauthorized option was being ignored
- SSL certificate validation was still happening despite agent config

Solution:
- Replace fetch() with native https.get() for French API
- Native https module properly supports rejectUnauthorized option
- Implement promise-based wrapper with proper error handling
- Maintain 5-second timeout protection
- Keep same response format and error handling

Technical details:
- Use https.get() with rejectUnauthorized: false option
- Stream response data and parse JSON manually
- Proper cleanup of timeout handlers
- Graceful error handling with empty array fallback

This fixes the "fetch failed" error seen in Railway logs.
French medications (DOLIPRANE, etc.) will now appear in results.
